# Group Chat Username Display Fix

## Problem
In the group chat module, actual usernames were not being displayed. Instead, user IDs were shown, making it difficult for users to identify who sent which message.

## Root Cause
The system was only sending `senderId` to the backend, and the frontend was trying to derive usernames from user IDs, which resulted in:
- Email addresses being displayed instead of real names
- Inconsistent username generation
- Poor user experience

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

**Updated Models to Include `senderName`:**

**`ChatMessage.java` (DTO):**
- Added `senderName` field
- Added getter/setter methods

**`GroupMessage.java` (Model):**
- Added `senderName` field  
- Updated constructor to accept `senderName`
- Added getter/setter methods

**Backend Controller:**
- No changes needed - already properly handles the new `senderName` field

### 2. Frontend Changes

**Updated `GroupChatService.ts`:**
- Modified `sendMessage()` method to include `senderName` in backend messages
- Ensured message has `senderName` before sending
- Backend now receives: `{ groupId, senderId, senderName, content }`

**Updated `GroupChatRoom.tsx`:**
- Modified message display to use `message.senderName` directly instead of deriving from `senderId`
- Updated `getUserInitials()` to accept and use `senderName` for proper avatar initials
- Fallback to `getUserDisplayName(senderId)` only when `senderName` is not available

### 3. Message Flow

**Sending Messages:**
1. User types message in UI
2. Frontend creates message with `senderName: getUserDisplayName(userId)`
3. Service ensures `senderName` is populated 
4. Backend receives message with actual username
5. Backend broadcasts message to all group members

**Receiving Messages:**
1. Backend sends message with `senderName` included
2. Frontend receives message with actual username
3. UI displays `message.senderName` directly
4. No more derivation from user IDs needed

### 4. Username Sources

**Current User:**
- Clerk user data (`user.firstName + user.lastName`)
- Fallback to localStorage `username`
- Final fallback to "You"

**Other Users:**  
- Now uses their actual `senderName` from when they sent the message
- No more email parsing or ID manipulation

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Proper Username Display**
- Real names like "John Smith" instead of "john.smith@email.com"
- Consistent across all users in the group

### ✅ **Better Avatars**
- Avatar initials now generated from actual names (e.g., "JS" for "John Smith")
- More professional appearance

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**
- Fallback mechanisms ensure old messages still display correctly
- Graceful degradation if `senderName` is missing

### ✅ **Real-time Experience**
- All new messages immediately show correct usernames
- No lag or inconsistency in username display

## Files Modified

### Backend:
1. `p2p-module/src/main/java/com/mini_project/p2p_chat/group_chat/DTO/ChatMessage.java`
2. `p2p-module/src/main/java/com/mini_project/p2p_chat/model/GroupMessage.java`

### Frontend:
1. `client/lib/GroupChatService.ts`
2. `client/components/GroupChat/GroupChatRoom.tsx`

## Testing Verification

### Before Fix:
- Messages showed: "user_12345 sent a message"
- Or: "john.smith@email.com sent a message"

### After Fix:
- Messages show: "John Smith sent a message"
- Avatars show: "JS" instead of "j" or "u"

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing messages with only `senderId` will still display using the fallback `getUserDisplayName()` method
- New messages will use the proper `senderName` field
- System gracefully handles both old and new message formats

The group chat now provides a much better user experience with proper username display, making conversations more natural and professional.
