# Video Call Stream Fix

## Problem Description
When a user joins a video chat room, their media was streamed to all previously joined users in the room, but the latest connected user didn't receive any video/audio streams from the existing participants.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the WebRTC peer connection establishment process:

1. **Backend Issue**: When a new user joined, the server only sent basic room information without details about existing participants
2. **Frontend Issue**: The new user had no information about existing participants, so no peer connections were established for them
3. **Missing Logic**: New users weren't getting the list of existing participants to create peer connections with

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`SignalingHandler.java`)

**Modified `handleApproveJoin()` method:**
- Now sends `existingParticipants` array to newly joined users
- Includes participant details: `userId`, `userName`, `isOwner`
- Provides room owner information (`ownerId`, `ownerName`)

```java
// Create existing participants array for the new user
ArrayNode existingParticipants = objectMapper.createArrayNode();
for (String participantId : room.participants.keySet()) {
    if (!participantId.equals(userId)) { // Don't include the new user themselves
        ObjectNode participant = objectMapper.createObjectNode();
        participant.put("userId", participantId);
        participant.put("userName", room.participants.get(participantId));
        participant.put("isOwner", participantId.equals(room.ownerId));
        existingParticipants.add(participant);
    }
}
```

### Frontend Changes (`SimpleVideoCallService.ts`)

**Modified `handleJoinApproved()` method:**
- Processes `existingParticipants` array from server
- Adds existing participants to the room's participant list
- Pre-creates peer connections for existing participants
- Sets proper room owner information

**Improved `handleUserJoined()` method:**
- Added check to prevent self-processing when user joins
- Better logging and error handling
- Prevents duplicate participant entries

**Enhanced `handleOffer()` method:**
- Improved error handling for media access
- Better peer connection management
- More robust offer/answer processing

**Improved `createPeerConnection()` method:**
- Better connection state checking
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Automatic cleanup of failed connections
- More detailed track information logging

### Frontend UI Changes (`SimpleVideoCallRoom.tsx`)

**Added Debug Information:**
- Real-time participant count
- Remote stream count
- Local stream status
- Participant and stream details

**Enhanced Logging:**
- Remote stream reception tracking
- Participant join/leave events
- Stream track information

## How the Fix Works

1. **When a new user requests to join:**
   - Server receives join request
   - Room owner approves the request

2. **Server sends join approval with existing participants:**
   - `join_approved` message now includes `existingParticipants` array
   - Contains all current room participants except the new user

3. **New user processes join approval:**
   - Creates room with existing participants
   - Gets local media stream
   - Pre-creates peer connections for existing participants
   - Waits for offers from existing participants

4. **Existing participants are notified:**
   - Receive `user_joined` message
   - Create offers for the new participant
   - Send offers via WebSocket

5. **New user receives offers:**
   - Processes offers from existing participants
   - Creates answers and sends back
   - ICE candidates are exchanged
   - WebRTC connections established
   - Remote streams start flowing

## Testing Steps

1. **Create a room** with User A
2. **Join the room** with User B (should see User A's stream)
3. **Join the room** with User C (should see both User A and User B streams)
4. **Verify all users** can see each other's video/audio streams
5. **Check debug panel** to ensure participant count matches stream count

## Debug Features Added

- Real-time debug panel showing:
  - Participant count
  - Remote stream count
  - Local stream status
  - Detailed participant list
  - Detailed remote stream list

- Enhanced console logging for:
  - Stream reception events
  - Peer connection states
  - Offer/answer processing
  - ICE candidate exchange

## Files Modified

1. `p2p-module/src/main/java/com/mini_project/p2p_chat/socket_communication/SignalingHandler.java`
2. `client/lib/SimpleVideoCallService.ts`
3. `client/components/VideoCall/SimpleVideoCallRoom.tsx`

This fix ensures that all participants in a video call can see and hear each other, regardless of when they join the room.
